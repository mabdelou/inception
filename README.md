# inception
Inception is a project that allows you to take a break from coding while providing ample learning opportunities. It covers essential topics such as containerization and its distinction from virtualization, Docker usage, building custom images, creating containers, and connecting them through networks and volumes. Additionally, you'll explore popular tools like WordPress, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP CGI, FTP, PhpMyAdmin, and more, along with how to modify their configuration files.

The project's main aim is to guide you in building your own web-site using these tools, each encapsulated within its container and interconnected for seamless control. Moreover, you'll gain invaluable problem-solving skills to tackle various software issues that may arise.
